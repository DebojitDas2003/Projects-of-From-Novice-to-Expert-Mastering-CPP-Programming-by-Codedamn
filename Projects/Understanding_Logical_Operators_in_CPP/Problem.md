#Understanding Logical Operators in C++
In this assignment, you will practice logical operators in C++ and how they are used to combine and evaluate logical expressions.

##Part 1: Logical Operators
Declare two boolean variables named a and b.
Initialize a to true and b to false.
Declare a third boolean variable named result.
Initialize result to the result of the && operator applied to a and b.
Print the value of result to the console.
Initialize result to the result of the || operator applied to a and b.
Print the value of result to the console.
Initialize result to the result of the ! operator applied to a.
Print the value of result to the console.

##Part 2: Short-Circuit Evaluation
Declare a boolean variable named c and initialize it to false.
Declare an integer variable named x and initialize it to 0.
Set the value of result to the result of the expression (c || (x = 42)).
Print the value of x to the console.
