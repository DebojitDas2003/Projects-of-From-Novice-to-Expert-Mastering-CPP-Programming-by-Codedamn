# Understanding Logical Operators in C++

In this assignment, you will practice logical operators in C++ and how they are used to combine and evaluate logical expressions.<br>

## Part 1: Logical Operators

Declare two boolean variables named a and b.<br>
Initialize a to true and b to false.<br>
Declare a third boolean variable named result.<br>
Initialize result to the result of the && operator applied to a and b.<br>
Print the value of result to the console.<br>
Initialize result to the result of the || operator applied to a and b.<br>
Print the value of result to the console.<br>
Initialize result to the result of the ! operator applied to a.<br>
Print the value of result to the console.<br>

## Part 2: Short-Circuit Evaluation

Declare a boolean variable named c and initialize it to false.<br>
Declare an integer variable named x and initialize it to 0.<br>
Set the value of result to the result of the expression (c || (x = 42)).<br>
Print the value of x to the console.<br>
